<h1>Diabetes Prediction Project using Python and Google Colab Notebook</h1>

<h3>Objective</h3>

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on relevant health metrics. The project will utilize Python programming language within Google Colab Notebook, along with popular libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
